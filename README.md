This game was created with love and kindness, written with perfect batch code, released, and receiving updates. We, VKANAVE, did it all. Our coders checked the game for bugs, our testers ensured the version was perfect, and our designers will help us with a few fine-tuning details. The game involves controlling a spaceship, where you are the captain, helping navigate the ship, explore planets, and trade for resources to upgrade it. The game also features a multiplayer system; please read the instructions. We wish you happy gaming and success in your new projects!
